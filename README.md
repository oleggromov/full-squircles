# Squircles supporting borders and background

This package is inspired by https://github.com/PavelLaptev/css-houdini-squircle. In fact, the code was copied and modified to support a simpler set of properties that my particular project needed:

```css
.squircle {
  --squircle-radius: 20px;
  --squircle-border-width: 3px;
  --squircle-border-color: red;
  --squircle-smooth: 5;
  --squircle-background-color: green;
}
```
